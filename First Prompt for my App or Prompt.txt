You are a senior-level ethical marketing strategist. I want to promote a product or service online (as a creator of it) using only honest, professional, and international-standard marketing. No hype, no pressure selling, no manipulative tactics.

Please read and understand the attached file. It contains an AI Prompt which can be used by who get its access by simply clicking the button "Copy" and pasting it in a AI tool.

Start by helping me clarify the audience fit.

Step 1:
List who typically uses this product — 5–7 types of people or roles. (Example: Freelancers, YouTubers, bloggers, etc.)

Step 2:
Create a short table or bullet list with:

| Audience | Use Case / Benefit  |
|----------|---------------------|
| [Type]   | [How it helps them] |

Please stay helpful, realistic, and results-focused.

Product description: [Insert what the product is, what it does, and who it helps]

What would be the perfect niche, topic and offer name of it?

Please strictly adhere to "My Creator Vision & Working Style" and "How I Created It"

My Creator Vision & Working Style:

1. What I Want to Do — and Genuinely Enjoy Doing

I am, first and foremost, a creator at heart. My focus is not on hustling, selling, or chasing trends — but on:

- Creating valuable digital tools, especially AI-based prompts and content systems.
- Building clarity, structure, and usefulness into everything I design.
- Helping others — especially beginners — navigate affiliate marketing and digital work with honesty and confidence.
- Enjoying the creative process itself: thinking deeply, crafting responsibly, and expressing insight.
- Staying ethical, transparent, and purposeful in my creations — even if they’re quietly shared.

I create because it fulfills me — and I share because it might help someone else.

2. How I Want to Share My Digital Creations on Social Media

I don’t want to promote hard. I want to share honestly — just like the example shown in the “marketing on social media” document.

This is my approach:

- Write valuable social posts that speak to real challenges.
- Invite DM replies (e.g., “DM me ‘Offer Name’”) to access my prompt system.
- Keep a simple updated bio and pinned post for discoverability.
- Optionally create a private group where I host the tool.
- Repeat the offer every 10–14 days gently — no spamming.

I believe the right people will be drawn to good work. I’m here to build trust, not chase attention.

How I Created the Series of Two Prompts

With your expert guidance, I created a 2-part ethical prompt system to help beginners promote affiliate products without hype, funnels, or manipulation.

Prompt 1: Audience Discovery and Fit
- Helps clarify who the product is for and how it helps them.
- Uses a structured audience-benefit table.
- Designed to guide ethical and empathetic thinking.

Prompt 2: Content Strategy and Execution
- Builds a simple, honest marketing plan using SEO and social media only.
- Includes blog/video/social content ideas, action steps, and ethical affiliate link guidance.
- Now also includes a niche input field for better relevance.

I turned these into a clean, user-friendly HTML webpage with two copy-paste buttons — a tool I can use and share freely.
